# Punch the Red

This is an archive repo for project of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI, CPS 3601).

## Project Description

A simple rhythm game prototype implemented on 8051-based MCU with 16x16 LED matrix.

## Demo

This picture shows the running demo of this prototype.

User input was got from the button board at right side of the picture.
That board is unstable when its back is touching to a surface,
 so a paper "protecting shell" was added to make the input stable.
